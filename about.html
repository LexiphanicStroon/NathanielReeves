            I used to work in the trades, pouring concrete and operating machines. 
            I always knew I wanted a career in tech though, and so I pursued a diploma in Full Stack Web Development.<br>
            I worked very hard, and learned something new every single day. I can't get enough of web development, and I never get bored of solving 
            problems and learning new ideas.<br><br>
            I like to work with small businesses because the web is saturated with very expensive very bloat filled websites.<br>The reality is a 
            small business owner typically isn't interested in paying thousands of dollars for a website built using complicated systems
            with functionality they will never use.<br><br>I want to work within your budget, and provide you only with what you need to have a strong, modern 
            online presence.
